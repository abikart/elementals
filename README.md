## Tokens - notes
- Asana uses a design token system that organizes tokens by four semantic attributes: sentiment, usage, prominence, and interaction. Asana's design tokens also use a hierarchical naming convention.
    - Sentiment: neutral, positive, negative, warning, informative etc (this could be a prop to the component)
    - usage: bg, fg, border, shadow, outline
    - prominence: default, weak, strong
    - interaction: default, hovered, pressed, focused, focusVisible, disabled
